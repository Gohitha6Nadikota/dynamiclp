            <p class="div7ba">Submitted by: Shivangi</p>
            <p class="div7ba">INDIA</p>
            <p class="div7b">I am a student and firm believer in the law of attraction and the Universe.</p>
            <p class="div7b">Hi everyone!</p>
            <p class="div7b">First of all, I want to thank Miss Rhonda Byrne, mother Universe, and all the beautiful people who share their Secret Success stories here.</p>
            <p class="div7b">I also want to say thank you for The Magic book.</p>
            <p class="div7b">I came to know about the law of attraction in June and I really wanted to use it. I always wanted to study abroad. And after I finished high school I got a chance to apply for it.</p>
            <p class="div7b">However, my family’s financial condition was not good enough to support me in my dream. So I had to apply for a scholarship.</p>
            <p class="div7b">So I applied for a scholarship and I started using The Magic and the law of attraction to get it. I used visualization, and scripting but as it was new for me, I did not have enough faith in it.</p>
            <p class="div7b"> And as a result, I did not get the scholarship I applied for.</p>
            <p class="div7b"> But after that, I started to look for more knowledge about the law of attraction and I started to read a lot of The Secret Success stories here as well as books related to the law of attraction(LOA).</p>
            <p class="div7b">After doing all of this, I again I started scripting, visualizing, and writing down what I was grateful for every day.</p>
            <p class="div7b">And after three and half months, out of blue, I received a call saying that they wanted to take my interview for a scholarship!</p>
            <p class="div7b">I did not know how this happened but I did know that if I could believe it, then I would be able to achieve it!</p>
